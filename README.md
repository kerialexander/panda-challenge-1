Module 4 Challenge - Pandas Challenge

# Project Overview
This module challenge focused on utilizing Python's Pandas library to conduct data analysis. In this challenge, we explored a dataset from a fictional e-commerce company to analyze real-world business questions and identify top customers, popular product categories, profits, and more.

**_Exploring the Data_**:The CSV file data was imported to enable the user to view the column names. The describe function was subsequently used to gather some basic statistics about the data. Pandas were used to identify the three item categories with the most entries, the subcategory with the most entries for the category with the most entries, and to identify the top 5 clients based on the clients with the most entries in the data. 

**_Transforming the Data_**: After the initial data analysis was completed, the data was transformed to facilitate better and easier analysis. This involved creating subtotal columns and columns for the cost of each line using unit cost, quantity, and shipping price. A column was also added to calculate the profit of each line using line cost and line price.

**_Confirming the Work_**: To ensure that the wholesale data analysis Pandas program ran as intended, data validation tools were implemented. Specifically, the code was designed to verify the calculation results matched the customer receipt data provided.

**_Summarizing and Analyzing_**: The newly created columns were used to identify the amount the top 5 clients by quantity spent. A summary DataFrame was then created to show the totals information for the top 5 clients. The data was then reformatted to display currency in millions of dollars and the columns were renamed to make them suitable for presentation.

### Programming Language
Python programming language was used to create the code for this project in Visual Studio Code.

## Resources 
I received assistance with importing the starter files into the terminal and creating a copy of the starter code. I attended office hours after class to troubleshoot a segment of my code in Part 2 of the challenge. I also attended a tutoring session to receive assistance with the .map function.
